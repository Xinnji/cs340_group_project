# Seen-it? Overview
This is a simple Flask web application running on Oregon State University servers built to interact with a SQL database also hosted by OSU. This application is built with all CRUD operations for 1:1, 1:M and M:M relationships in a SQL database with 5 entities. It is not built to be user-oriented (no error prevention, instructions, etc.), nor was it made totally dynamic as might be possible with some more Flask templating. After Fall 2021, the backend DB will be deleted, so this app likely will not function. Built in collaboration with Nicholas Broce for CS340 (Intro to Databases).
