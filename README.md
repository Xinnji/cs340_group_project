# Seen-it? Overview
This is a simple Flask web application running on Oregon State University servers built to interact with a SQL database also hosted by OSU. It's called Seen-it? and tracks people you know and the movies, TV shows, books and video games they have consumed in order to prevent any spoilers in everyday conversation.

This application is built with all CRUD operations for 1:1, 1:M and M:M relationships in a SQL database with 5 entities. It is not built to be user-oriented (no error prevention, instructions, etc.), nor was it made totally dynamic as might be possible with some more Flask templating. After Fall 2021, the backend DB will be deleted, so this app will likely not function, though we have plans to transition to a Heroku app for greater longevity and accessibility. To access the instance running on OSU servers you will need to be on campus or use a VPN.

Built in collaboration with Nicholas Broce for CS340 (Intro to Databases).
